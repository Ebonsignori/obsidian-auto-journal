# Auto Journal

The core [Daily notes](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Daily+notes) plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) doesn't backfill notes for the days when Obsidian wasn't opened. This plugin does.

It uses an opinionated folder structure that isn't configurable:

-   **Daily Notes**: `ROOT / YEAR / MONTH / DAY -`
-   **Monthly Notes**: `ROOT / YEAR / {custom-name} / MONTH -`

You can customize the date format of `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`, or set/remove the `ROOT`, but this plugin depends on organizing the filesystem by `YEAR`/`MONTH`/`DAY`.

The base of the filename in each folder should not be changed, e.g. `DAY -` for Daily Notes or `MONTH -` for Monthly Notes.

For instance, by default Daily Notes will be created like so,

`Journal/2023/August/11 -`

You can add whatever you'd like after the title,

`Journal/2023/August/11 - Work, Dog Park, Climb with Friends & Grab Dinner`

But make sure not to change the day part of the title, `11 -`

## Backfilling

When enabled, backfilling will create notes for previous days of the month/year when you didn't open the plugin.

For Daily Notes:

-   `For year` backfill will create a folder for each month before today and a note with the day prefix, e.g. `11 -` for each day of the month before today
-   `For month` backfill will create a note with the day prefix, e.g. `11 -` for each day of the month before today

For Monthly Notes:

-   `For year` backfill will a note each month before today month prefix, e.g. `January -` for each month of the year before this month

### Templating the date in a backfill

You can include a configurable token in a template to be replaced by the date that the file would have been created in a backfill.

By default, the token `<$date-from-auto-journal$>` will be replaced by a date in format `YYYY-MM-DD`. If you add the date to your frontmatter, e.g. `date: <$date-from-auto-journal$>` you can use that date in other plugins.

## Plugins that pair well for daily journaling


-   [Custom File Explorer sorting](https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort) Since the default names of each journal are the full names of the months e.g. `January` the following `sortspec` file placed in the root folder of your journal will organize them in the correct order on your filesystem.

-   [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater): Useful for inserting dates and other properties into your journal entry template.

    -   **Required:** You must enable the _"Trigger Templater on new file creation"_ setting for templater to work with Auto Journal
    -   <details>
        <summary>
        Click to see journal template
        </summary>

        ```
        ---
        date: <$date-from-auto-journal$>
        tag: journal
        ---

        # <% moment(tp.frontmatter.date).format("dddd, MMMM DD, YYYY") %> ðŸ“†

        ## People ðŸ‘¤
        -

        ## Grateful For ðŸ’™


        ## Photos ðŸ“¸

        ```

        The frontmatter date set via Auto Journal token can be consumed by Templater in other functions, e.g. `<% moment(tp.frontmatter.date).format("dddd, MMMM DD, YYYY") %>`

        </details>

-   [Reminder](https://github.com/uphy/obsidian-reminder) Can include a reminder combined with Templater to be notified when a monthly check-in is due to be filled out.

    -   <details>
        <summary>
        Click to see check-in template
        </summary>

        ```

        date: <$date-from-auto-journal$>
        tag: check-in
        ---
        # **<% moment(tp.frontmatter.date).format("MMMM, YYYY") %>  Check In** ðŸ“†

        - [ ] Fill out Check In  ðŸ“† <% moment(tp.frontmatter.date).format("YYYY-MM-DD") %>

        ### 1. How are you? How was this month?


        ### 2. What did you prioritize this month?


        ### 3. Where do you see yourself in 1, 3, & 5 years? Has your long term vision changed?


        ### 4. Are your habits and goals aligned with this current vision? If so what needs to be changed to meet them?


        ### 5. Is there anything missing from your life?


        ### 6. Take back to reflect on the month. What progress did you make? What are you grateful for?


        ### 7. What are looking forward to in the next month?
        ```

        The above example uses the Tasks Plugin date format which must be set in Reminder's settings.

-   [@ Symbol Linking](https://github.com/Ebonsignori/obsidian-at-symbol-linking) I keep a `People` directory at the top of my journal that I regularly link to with the `@` symbol. You can configure this plugin to only look for links in that directory when typing `@`.

-   [Google Photos](https://github.com/alangrainger/obsidian-google-photos) Useful way to include photos in each of your entries while storing them in a separate app. This plugin will create thumbnails so you can still see the photos, but they'll be hosted by Google and not take up space in your vault.

## Installing

The preferred method is adding this through the [built-in community plugin browser](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/Community+plugins) in Obsidian.

### Manual installation

1. Create a new folder in your vault, `.obsidian/plugins/auto-journal`
1. Download and move the files from the latest release in the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Ebonsignori/obsidian-auto-journal/releases) to the new folder, `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-auto-journal`
1. In Obsidian go to `Settings -> Community Plugins`
1. Enable community plugins if they aren't already enabled, then and enable the checkbox for `Auto Journal`

## Contributing

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/Ebonsignori/obsidian-auto-journal/issues/new) with any suggestions or bug reports.

Or feel free to fork and open a PR :heart:

### Local development

1. Move this to your `.obsidian/plugins` directory in a vault you don't mind messing with.
1. `npm i`
1. `npm run dev`
1. Add [hot-reload](https://github.com/pjeby/hot-reload) to the same `.obsidian/plugins` directory and enable it in Obsidian to ease development.

### Releasing

Once changes are in `main`, add a tag reflecting the new semver (without the `v` prefix) and push the tag to the repo.

For example:

```
git tag 1.0.0
git push origin 1.0.0
```

[Release.yml](./.github/workflows/release.yml) will handle bumping the version and publishing a release to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Ebonsignori/obsidian-auto-journal/releases).

Remember to update the [newest release](https://github.com/Ebonsignori/obsidian-auto-journal/releases) notes with any relevant changes.
