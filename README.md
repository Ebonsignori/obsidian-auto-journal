# Auto Journal

The core [Daily notes](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Daily+notes) plugin doesn't backfill notes for the days you didn't open Obsidian. This plugin does.

It uses an opinionated folder structure that isn't configurable:
  - **Daily Notes**: `ROOT / YEAR / MONTH / DAY -`
  - **Monthly Notes**: `ROOT / YEAR / {custom-name} / MONTH -`

You can customize the date format of `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`, or set/remove the `ROOT`, but this plugin depends on organizing the filesystem by `YEAR`/`MONTH`/`DAY`.

The base of the filename in each folder should not be changed, e.g. `DAY -` for Daily Notes or `MONTH -` for Monthly Notes.

For instance, by default Daily Notes will be created like so,

`Journal/2023/August/11 -`

You can add whatever you'd like after the title,

`Journal/2023/August/11 - Work, Dog Park, Climb with Friends & Grab Dinner`

But make sure not to change the day part of the title, `11 -`

## Backfilling

When enabled, backfilling will create notes for previous days of the month/year when you didn't open the plugin.

For Daily Notes:
  - `For year` backfill will create a folder for each month before today and a note with the day prefix, e.g. `11 -` for each day of the month before today
  - `For month` backfill will create a note with the day prefix, e.g. `11 -` for each day of the month before today

For Monthly Notes:
  - `For year` backfill will a note each month before today month prefix, e.g. `January -` for each month of the year before this month

## Plugins that pair well for daily journaling

- [Custom File Explorer sorting](https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort) Since the default names of each journal are the full names of the months e.g. `January` the following `sortspec` file placed in the root folder of your journal will organize them in the correct order on your filesystem.

  ### 1. How are you? How was this month?


  ### 2. What did you prioritize this month?


  ### 3. Where do you see yourself in 1, 3, & 5 years? Has your long term vision changed?


  ### 4. Are your habits and goals aligned with this current vision? If so what needs to be changed to meet them?


  ### 5. Is there anything missing from your life?


  ### 6. Take back to reflect on the month. What progress did you make? What are you grateful for?


  ### 7. What are looking forward to in the next month?

- [@ Symbol Linking](https://github.com/Ebonsignori/obsidian-at-symbol-linking) I keep a `People` directory at the top of my journal that I regularly link to with the `@` symbol. You can configure this plugin to only look for links in that directory when typing `@`.

- [Google Photos](https://github.com/alangrainger/obsidian-google-photos) Useful way to include photos in each of your entries while storing them in a separate app. This plugin will create thumbnails so you can still see the photos, but they'll be hosted by Google and not take up space in your vault.

## Installing

The preferred method is adding this through the [built-in community plugin browser](https://help.obsidian.md/Extending+Obsidian/Community+plugins) in Obsidian.

### Manual installation

1. Create a new folder in your vault, `.obsidian/plugins/auto-journal`
1. Download and move the files from the latest release in the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Ebonsignori/obsidian-auto-journal/releases) to the new folder, `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-auto-journal`
1. In Obsidian go to `Settings -> Community Plugins`
1. Enable community plugins if they aren't already enabled, then and enable the checkbox for `Auto Journal`

## Contributing 

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/Ebonsignori/obsidian-auto-journal/issues/new) with any suggestions or bug reports.

Or feel free to fork and open a PR :heart:

The implementation borrows from:

- [auto-note-mover](https://github.com/farux/obsidian-auto-note-mover): For file suggesting in settings 

### Local development

1. Move this to your `.obsidian/plugins` directory in a vault you don't mind messing with.
1. `npm i`
1. `npm run dev`
1. Add [hot-reload](https://github.com/pjeby/hot-reload) to the same `.obsidian/plugins` directory and enable it in Obsidian to ease development.

### Releasing

Once changes are in `main`, add a tag reflecting the new semver (without the `v` prefix) and push the tag to the repo.

For example:
```
git tag 1.0.0
git push origin 1.0.0
```

[Release.yml](./.github/workflows/release.yml) will handle bumping the version and publishing a release to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Ebonsignori/obsidian-auto-journal/releases).

Remember to update the [newest release](https://github.com/Ebonsignori/obsidian-auto-journal/releases) notes with any relevant changes.
